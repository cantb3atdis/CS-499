# CS-499-Capstone
# Professional ePortfolio Overview

## Introduction

As the final step in my journey toward a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, the capstone project involves creating a professional electronic portfolio (ePortfolio). This portfolio integrates the knowledge and skills developed throughout the program, demonstrating growth and proficiency in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

## Purpose

The ePortfolio serves as a comprehensive showcase of my abilities to potential employers, highlighting technical prowess, problem-solving capabilities, and professional development in the software industry. It provides tangible evidence of skills, supporting career advancement and employment opportunities.

## Milestones

### Milestone One: Code Review

In Module Two, I will conduct a code review of selected artifacts for enhancement. The video code review will analyze current functionalities, identify areas for improvement, and outline enhancement plans.

### Milestone Two: Enhancement One - Software Design and Engineering

Module Three focuses on enhancing an artifact related to software design and engineering. This includes improving software functionality, optimizing code structure, and incorporating advanced programming concepts.

### Milestone Three: Enhancement Two - Algorithms and Data Structure

Module Four enhances an artifact emphasizing algorithms and data structures. This involves enhancing efficiency, scalability, and complexity using advanced algorithms and optimized data structures.

### Milestone Four: Enhancement Three - Databases

Module Five enhances an artifact related to databases. This includes integrating advanced database concepts, optimizing data querying, and enhancing data management capabilities.

### Final Submission: ePortfolio and Professional Self-Assessment

Module Seven marks the submission of the final ePortfolio, featuring polished artifacts with associated narratives. It includes a professional self-assessment reflecting on my journey through the program, skills developed, and career aspirations.

## Components of the ePortfolio

1. **Code Review Video**
   - Analysis of existing functionalities and planned enhancements.
   - Identification of skills demonstrated in software engineering, algorithms, data structures, and databases.

2. **Enhanced Artifacts**
   - Original artifacts enhanced to demonstrate proficiency in software design, algorithms, data structures, and databases.
   - Each artifact accompanied by a narrative justifying its inclusion, enhancements made, skills demonstrated, challenges faced, and alignment with course outcomes.

3. **Professional Self-Assessment**
   - Reflection on coursework, skills development, and preparation for a professional career in computer science.
   - Discussion on collaboration, communication, technical proficiency in data structures, algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security.
   - Summary linking artifacts and narratives to demonstrate comprehensive technical abilities.

## Conclusion

The professional ePortfolio represents the culmination of academic achievements and practical skills gained throughout the Computer Science program. It presents a cohesive narrative of growth, proficiency, and readiness for roles in software development and computer science fields.

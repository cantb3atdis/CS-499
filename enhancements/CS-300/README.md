# CS-300: Enhancements

## CS-300 Project: Advising Assistance Software Development

Throughout the CS-300 course, I worked on developing an advising assistance software for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The goal of the project was to create a program that could load data from a file, store it in a data structure, and allow advisors to look up and display information about courses and their prerequisites.

### Approach and Enhancements

1. **Requirements Analysis:** I studied and analyzed the project requirements thoroughly to understand the scope and functionalities needed.
   
2. **Data Structure Selection:** After researching various options, I integrated a hash table data structure. This choice aimed to optimize data operations such as searching and insertion, achieving O(1) average time complexity for efficient performance.

3. **Iterative Development:** I iterated on designs and implementations based on feedback and peer reviews, enhancing the software's robustness and usability.

4. **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to manage issues like duplicate entries and input errors effectively.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Data Parsing:** Initially faced challenges with parsing data from input files. Overcame these by breaking down the problem into smaller parts and conducting incremental testing.

### Learning Outcomes

- **Software Design Skills:** Enhanced skills in analyzing requirements, selecting appropriate data structures, and planning solutions using pseudocode and iterative testing.
  
- **Best Practices:** Acquired knowledge in command-line program development, error handling, and code readability best practices.

### Conclusion

This project significantly advanced my ability to design and develop software applications, emphasizing maintainability, readability, and adaptability through industry-standard practices.
